This section is a collection of special use cases that might be encountered when working with UI5 Web Components for React.

## Adding custom components to slots

With our wrapper we provide an easy way to consume the `slots` of the UI5 Web Components by attaching them to a `prop`.
In most cases you don't have to take anything into account, and the props can be used in a typical React way. However, there is an exception with custom components:

```jsx
const BarStart = () => {
  return <div>Start</div>;
};
const BarEnd = () => {
  return <Button>Close</Button>;
};
export const BarComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Bar startContent={<BarStart />} middleContent={<div>I'm not a custom component</div>} endContent={<BarEnd />} />
  );
};
```

The `BarComponent` would compile to this:

<FaultyBarComponent />

As you can see, both custom components are not displayed.
Our wrapper does add the `slot` prop to the custom component, but the most outer HTML-Element/component (e.g. `<div>Start</div>`) does not accept it and therefore cannot use it.

To fix this the `slot` prop must also be passed to the outer element of the component:

```jsx
const BarStart = (props) => {
  return <div slot={props.slot}>Start</div>;
};
const BarEnd = (props) => {
  return <Button slot={props.slot}>Close</Button>;
};
export const BarComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Bar startContent={<BarStart />} middleContent={<div>I'm not a custom component</div>} endContent={<BarEnd />} />
  );
};
```

Now the `BarComponent` would compile to this:

<BarComponent />
